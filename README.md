# Numerical Methods Solver Suite

A curated MATLAB collection of numerical analysis solvers implementing root-finding, integration, systems of nonlinear equations, ODE solvers, and fluid dynamics simulations. Developed as part of advanced coursework in numerical methods.

##  Features

### Root-Finding Techniques
- **Bisection**, **Secant**, and **Newton-Raphson** methods for solving non-linear equations (e.g., spherical tank depth, projectile motion).

### Numerical Integration
- **Trapezoidal**, **Simpsonâ€™s**, and **Gauss-Legendre Quadrature** to estimate physical quantities like magnetic field from Biot-Savart law.

### Nonlinear Systems
- Newton-Raphson method to solve a system of biochemical equations involving substrate and biomass concentration.

### ODE Solvers
- Simulation of spring-mass-damper system using **Euler** and **Runge-Kutta (RK4)** methods.
- Analysis of projectile trajectory under gravity and air drag.

### Finite Difference Method (FDM)
- Couette flow profile analysis using second-order FDM and validation with exact solution.
